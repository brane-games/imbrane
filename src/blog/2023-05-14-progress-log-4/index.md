Demo of my game is still hidden from the public eye but some awesome folks tried it. If you want to test early builds then checkout discord: https://discord.gg/HYV8Zz8V2Q

So the demo is out and being played by strangers for the first time. It's really hard to get that out of the way as you don't want to scare people away by giving them too raw experience.

I'm happy that people really **had fun** and deemed it worthy to spend time not only playing but also **providing valuable feedback**. A lot of great ideas were generated in the first playthrough and this really gives me new motivation to continue making the best chess game out there!

I appreciate people giving feedback (the good and the bad!) so I decided to create a small public page where all the bugs reported can be seen and progress on them can be monitored. (this was _also a suggestion from Discord_ :) )

## What next?

- I've decided to ditch selectable campaigns for inital release of the game. It's just going to be your custom chess prodigy. Enter: Player creation screen:

- I've compiled Godot Engine from source in an attempt to catch and eradicate a game breaking bug that has sneaked in the game. It's very hard to diagnose what's wrong so I can fix it.
- When the bug is fixed, I'll start readying the build for Steam
- Release demo on Steam! I'd love to do it as soon as possible, I hope by the end of May, but it is going to be tricky if this bug keeps bothering me.

Until next time!
