Hey @everyone, it's been two weeks since MoC demo has had its first public testing. I want to thank everyone for the amazing feedback and especially @Dieu#2536 for some very constructive ideas! The demo is getting more polished with each iteration. Let me know how good it is and if you find any issues with it!

I'm in the process of getting the demo approved on Steam! It should be there soon and I believe it's going to be available in the first half of June.

New feature:
Tournament overview screen

Gameplay improvements:

1. When energy is under 20% the player no longer gives out his opinion on moves. @Dieu#2536
2. Character does not lose energy when he isn't calculating @Dieu#2536

Usability fixes:

1. Displaying ranks and files on the board @Qu11k#2305
2. Icons are no longer blurry @Zokaper#7964
3. Chess pieces are no longer blurry @Zokaper#7964
4. Chess avatars a little bit more consolidated @Zokaper#7964
5. Energy icons/animations improved
6. After match is simulated a more intuitive text is displayed @Taxtibe#5548
7. Skip tactic functionality

Bug fixes:

1. Premature resignation no longer happens @robs#1932
2. Board does not flip any more (I am not sure I covered all the cases but I can't reproduce any more) @Dieu#2536
3. Opponents stops playing from nowhere @Dieu#2536

And bunch more less noticable stuff and issues.
